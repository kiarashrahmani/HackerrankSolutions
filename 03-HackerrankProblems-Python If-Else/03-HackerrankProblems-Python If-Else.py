# Prompt the user to input two numbers
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

# Calculate the sum, difference, and product using the input numbers
sum = int(a) + int(b)
difference = int(a) - int(b)
product = int(a) * int(b)

# Display the calculated results
print(sum)  # Output the sum
print(difference)  # Output the difference
print(product)  # Output the product
